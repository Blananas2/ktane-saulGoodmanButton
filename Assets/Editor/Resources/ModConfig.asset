  author: Blananas2
  description: 'I had a good job until my boss accused me of stealing! I better call
    Saul! I was out partying minding my own business. You are under arrest! I''d better
    call Saul! Hi I''m Saul Goodman. Did you know that you have rights? The Constitution
    says you do, and so do I. I believe that until proven guilty every man, woman
    and child in this country is innocent, and that''s why I fight for you Albuquerque!
    Better call Saul!
